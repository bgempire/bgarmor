# BGArmor

## Directory: data

This directory is used to store the game source files. While using BGArmor and 
its helper scripts, this `data` folder is assumed as default, and while the 
main blend file in the root of this folder is preferable, there are not 
restrictions in order to sctructure this directory's content.
