# Source
Contains general development files that will not be used at the game release.

## Folder: source/icons
Contains icons of the game executables (both BGArmor's launcher and blenderplayer 
executables). Those icons are used automatically by the related utility scripts 
such as `win-set-icons.bat`.

## Folder: source/tools
Contains BGArmor's thirdy party helper tools and more complex Python-based utility 
scripts. Usually the end-user don't need to mess with this directory and its files 
unless needed.
