# Data
This directory is used to store the game source files. While using BGArmor and 
its helper scripts, this `data` folder is assumed as default, and while the main 
blend file in the root of this folder is preferable, there are not restrictions 
in order to sctructure this directory's content.

After downloading a [BGArmor release](https://github.com/bgempire/bgarmor/releases) 
you can delete all files inside `data` directory, as they are only example files. 
Paste your game source files instead.
