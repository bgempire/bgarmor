# BGArmor

## Introduction
BGArmor is a Blender Game Engine and UPBGE tool that allows you to obfuscate your game source files and run them separated from the blenderplayer executable. It's available on Windows and Linux.

This project was inspired by BPPlayer, but at the same it's not as reliable as it (due to its simplistic concept behind the curtains), it aims to be more compatible and portable. It also features a project development structure to aid the game development workflow and ease the release process.

Take a look at the [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/bgempire/bgarmor/wiki/Quickstart-Guide) on the [wiki](https://github.com/bgempire/bgarmor/wiki) to learn how to implement BGArmor in your project.

## Additional Features
BGArmor also aims to provide a toolchain of scripts to automate the process of game release, including scripts to create the obfuscated data files and generate releases, a launcher and blenderplayer icon changer (on Windows) and others.

## Wishlist
Some intended features include:

- Windows installer automated packaging
- Linux .desktop files generator and automated .deb packaging
