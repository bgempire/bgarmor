# BGArmor

## Introduction
BGArmor is a Blender Game Engine and UPBGE tool that allows you to package your game data files and launch them separated from the blenderplayer executable. It's available on Windows and Linux.

This project was inspired by BPPlayer, but it aims to be more compatible and portable. It also features a project development structure to aid the game development workflow and ease the release process.

Take a look at the [Quickstart Guide](https://bgempire.github.io/bgarmor/quickstart) on the [manual](https://bgempire.github.io/bgarmor/) to learn how to implement BGArmor in your project.

## Additional Features
BGArmor also aims to provide a toolchain of tasks to automate the process of game release, including tasks to package the game data files and generate releases, a launcher and blenderplayer icon changer (on Windows) and others.
